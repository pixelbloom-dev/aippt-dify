# Privacy Policy for AiPPT.cn Dify Plugin

This Privacy Policy explains how the AiPPT.cn Plugin ("the Plugin") collects, uses, and handles your information when used within the Dify platform.

## 1. Information We Handle

### a. **AiPPT.cn API Key**
To use the Plugin, you are required to provide your personal AiPPT.cn API Key. This key is securely stored by the Dify platform, in accordance with its security protocols. The Plugin uses this key solely to authenticate requests to the AiPPT.cn API on your behalf.

### b. **AiPPT.cn Workspace Data**
Depending on the function you invoke — including:
- **Generate Outline** (`generation-outline`)
- **Generate Content** (`generation-content`)
- **Select Template** (`template-list`)
- **Generate Design** (`generation-design`)

— the Plugin interacts with the AiPPT.cn API to fetch or process related data from your AiPPT.cn workspace. This data may include project content, templates, or generated documents. The Plugin does **not** store this data persistently. All retrieved information is processed in memory and passed back to the Dify platform for display or further handling.

### c. **Usage Data**
General usage data (e.g., frequency of use, tool interactions) may be collected by the Dify platform as part of its standard analytics. This is governed by Dify’s [Privacy Policy](https://dify.ai/privacy).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- **API Key**: Used only to authenticate your identity when making requests to the AiPPT.cn API.
- **Workspace Data**: Accessed and used only to perform the specific operation you request through the Plugin, such as generating content or listing templates. This data is neither stored nor used for any other purpose.

## 3. Data Storage

The Plugin does not maintain its own persistent data storage.  
- Your API key is stored and managed by the Dify platform.  
- Any data fetched from AiPPT.cn is processed temporarily and discarded after use.

## 4. Third-Party Services

This Plugin interacts exclusively with the **AiPPT.cn API**. By using the Plugin, you agree to the terms set forth by AiPPT.cn. Please review their [Terms of Service](https://www.aippt.cn/help/user-agreement) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.aippt.cn/help/privacy-policy) for more details.

## 5. Your Choices

You can revoke the Plugin’s access to your AiPPT.cn account at any time by:
- Deleting or resetting your API Key in your AiPPT.cn account settings:  
  [AiPPT.cn Open Platform](https://open.aippt.cn/)  
- Removing or reconfiguring the Plugin within your Dify application.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be published in the Plugin’s description or official documentation. Continued use of the Plugin after changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
